Photography Untouched is a personal project to showcase a collection of photographs I've taken over the years. What sets the project apart from other photography sites, is the fact that all the photos are original and have not been edited.

The front-end of Photography Untouched is built with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. The backend is built with Django.

Currently working on: adding photo cropping functionality using Pillow.
